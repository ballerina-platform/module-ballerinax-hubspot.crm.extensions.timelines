# Sanitation for OpenAPI specification

This document records the sanitation done on top of the official OpenAPI specification from HubSpot CRM Timelines.
The OpenAPI specification is obtained from (TODO: Add source link).
These changes are done in order to improve the overall usability, and as workarounds for some known language limitations.

1. Change the `url` property of the servers object

**Original**: `https://api.hubspot.com`

**Updated**: `https://api.hubapi.com/integrators/timeline/v3`

**Reason**: This change of adding the common prefix `integrators/timeline/v3` to the base url, makes it easier to access endpoints using the client.

2. Update the API Paths

**Original**: Paths included common prefix above in each endpoint. (eg: `/integrators/timeline/v3`)

**Updated**: Common prefix is now removed from the endpoints as it is included in the base URL.

**Reason**: This change simplifies the API paths, making them shorter and more readable.

3. Update the `date-time` into `datetime` to make it compatible with the ballerina type conversions

**Original**: `format: date-time`

**Updated**: `format: datetime`

**Reason**: The `date-time` format is not compatible with the OpenAPI tool. Therefore, it is updated to `datetime` to make it compatible with the tool.

4. Update the `createdAt` property in `TimelineEventTemplate` to support nullable values

**Original**:

```json
"createdAt" : {
  "type" : "string",
  "description" : "The date and time that the Event Template was created, as an ISO 8601 timestamp. Will be null if the template was created before Feb 18th, 2020.",
  "format" : "datetime"
}
```

**Updated**:

```json
"createdAt" : {
  "type" : "string",
  "description" : "The date and time that the Event Template was created, as an ISO 8601 timestamp. Will be null if the template was created before Feb 18th, 2020.",
  "format" : "datetime",
  "nullable" : true
}
```

**Reason**: The properties `"createdAt"` is updated to be nullable, meaning it can either hold their respective values or be null, to fix payload binding error.

5. Update the `createdAt` property in `TimelineEventResponse` to support nullable values

**Original**:

```json
"createdAt" : {
  "type" : "string",
  "format" : "datetime"
}
```

**Updated**:

```json
"createdAt" : {
  "type" : "string",
  "format" : "datetime",
  "nullable": true
}
```

**Reason**: The properties `"createdAt"` is updated to be nullable, meaning it can either hold their respective values or be null, to fix payload binding error.

6. Update the `objectPropertyName` property in `TimelineEventTemplateToken` to support nullable values

**Original**:

```json
"objectPropertyName" : {
  "type" : "string",
  "description" : "The name of the CRM object property. This will populate the CRM object property associated with the event. With enough of these, you can fully build CRM objects via the Timeline API.",
  "example" : "customPropertyPetType"
}
```

**Updated**:

```json
"objectPropertyName" : {
  "type" : "string",
  "description" : "The name of the CRM object property. This will populate the CRM object property associated with the event. With enough of these, you can fully build CRM objects via the Timeline API.",
  "example" : "customPropertyPetType",
  "nullable" : true
}
```

**Reason**: The property `objectPropertyName` is updated to be nullable, meaning it can either hold their respective values or be null, to fix a payload binding error.

## OpenAPI cli command

The following command was used to generate the Ballerina client from the OpenAPI specification. The command should be executed from the repository root directory.

```bash
bal openapi -i docs/spec/openapi.json --mode client --license docs/license.txt -o ballerina
```

Note: The license year is hardcoded to 2025, change if necessary.
